# Sudoku-Webapp
Here, I have aimed to create a webapp of Sudoku. It is written in HTML, CSS, and Js. A sudoku grid is displayed alongside the digits 1-9. The main function is to select a digit and insert it in a sqaure OR select a sqaure and then select a digit to be inserted at that square. Extra features include: a _lives_ counter, a _timer_, and an _instructions_ popup menu.
<br>The sudoku puzzle is hosted live on https://kshah2089.github.io/Sudoku-Webapp/.
